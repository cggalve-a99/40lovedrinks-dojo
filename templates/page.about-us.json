Sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt, is a fast-acting form that helps restore the sodium lost through sweat and supports hydration, muscle function, and nerve signaling. <br/><br/></p><p>Sodium citrate is a more advanced form, combining sodium with citric acid for smoother digestion and added benefits like buffering acid buildup in the body. It’s especially helpful during endurance efforts, as it can reduce the risk of cramping and fatigue. 40-Love, uses a smart blend of both to deliver hydration that works hard and feels good.</p>",
